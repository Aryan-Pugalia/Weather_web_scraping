# Weather_web_scraping
<br>
<h4>Using Selenium's webdriver module and bs4 BeautifulSoup module, we can webscrape the required weather data.</h4>
<br>

 - We Used Selenium to open up the website and extract the page source.<br>
 - We then used bs4 to find the elements required such as the table we require.<br>
 - Then we used pandas to convert the data into CSV and store into local Computer.<br>
 - We can loop it for as many years as we like.
